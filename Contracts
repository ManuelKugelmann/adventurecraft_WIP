Complete Action Framework - Current Draft SummaryCore Attributes (9 total - 3×3 structure)Physical (3)Strength: raw physical power (used in skills)Agility: coordination/speed (used in skills)Body: physical endurance/health/hit points (resource)Mental (3)Willpower: raw mental power/force (used in skills)Intelligence: mental coordination/analysis (used in skills)Spirit: mental endurance/magical stamina (resource)Social (3)Authority: raw social power/dominance (derived from relationships)Charisma: social coordination/charm (used in skills)Reputation: social standing (derived from relationships)Actions & Skills (7 actions, 23 skills total)Skills = Methods (1:1 mapping)Each action has 3 strategic approaches: Direct/Leveraged/StructuredMOVE: Athletics, Riding, Travel
MODIFY: Operate, Equipment, Crafting  
ATTACK: Melee, Ranged, Traps
DEFENSE: Active Defense, Armor, Tactics
TRANSFER: Gathering, Trade, Administration
INFLUENCE: Persuasion, Authority, Intrigue
SENSE: Search, Observation, ResearchMeta-Skills (2)Stealth: reduces detection across all actionsAwareness: improves threat detection across all actionsAction FrameworkUniversal ParametersACTION(target, method, [objects], intensity, secrecy)Key MechanicsStealth vs Effectiveness: High stealth reduces action effectivenessIntensity vs Stealth: High intensity penalizes stealth capabilityDeception: Replace action prerequisites with false objectsMultiple Objects: Actions can use multiple tools/resourcesCharacter SystemHierarchical Groups & IndividualsGROUP/ACTOR {
  PARENT: inheritance_chain,
  TEMPLATE: {stat_overrides},  // only store differences from parent
  MEMBERS: [sub_groups, individuals]
}Groups inherit from parent groupsIndividuals inherit from groupsOnly store differences, not complete stat blocksDrives (6 total - motivational stats 0-100)survival, luxury, dominance, belonging, knowledge, lawful, moralRelationship System (4-axis per relationship)RELATIONSHIP: {
  debt: obligation_balance (-100 to +100),
  reputation: fear_to_respect (-100 to +100),  
  affection: hate_to_love (-100 to +100),
  familiarity: interaction_history (0-100)
}Derived Authority FormulaAuthority = (debt + abs(reputation) + affection) / 3Multi-Level RelationshipsIndividual relationships: between specific actorsGroup relationships: between groups, inherited by membersFamiliarity as weighting: high familiarity = personal relationship dominates general reputationKnowledge System (Hierarchical with lazy evaluation)KNOWLEDGE: {
  generic: {"medieval_warfare": 70},           // broad understanding
  specialized: {"siege_tactics": 90},          // refined domains  
  detailed: {"specific_battle_plan": {...}}   // generated when needed
}Generic knowledge: covers vast areas efficientlyDetails generated only when needed by Investigation skill + relevant generic knowledgePermanent storage: once resolved, detailed knowledge persistsTrade-off MechanicsStealth vs EffectivenessHigh Stealth: Reduces action effectiveness, improves concealmentHigh Intensity: Reduces stealth capability, improves action powerNatural tension: Can't maximize both stealth and effectivenessAwareness vs FocusHigh Awareness: Better threat detection, reduced task effectivenessDivided attention: Meta-skill trade-offs prevent overpowered combinationsDesign PrinciplesEmergent ComplexityAuthority/Reputation emerge from actual relationship patternsCharacter flaws emerge from drive imbalances (high survival + low moral = cowardice)Social dynamics emerge from relationship interactionsComputational EfficiencyHierarchical inheritance minimizes memory usageLazy knowledge evaluation generates details only when neededDerived social stats calculated from relationships, not stored separatelyStrategic Depth3 approaches per action create meaningful tactical choices23-skill system provides specialization without overwhelming complexityMulti-axis relationships enable nuanced social dynamicsUniversal FrameworkSame 7 actions handle everything from combat to politics to craftingScales seamlessly from individual conversations to kingdom managementMethod flexibility allows adjustment of granularity per domainTotal System Components9 attributes (7 for skills, 2 for resources)7 core actions with universal parameters23 skills (21 core + 2 meta) using 3-approach structure4-axis relationships with derived authority/reputationHierarchical knowledge with lazy detail generation6 drive stats for character motivationNested group inheritance for efficient world populationThe framework provides simulation depth comparable to Dwarf Fortress while maintaining organizational clarity and computational efficiency suitable for large-scale world simulation.
