### Rolemaster Skill Categories (RMSS) with Stat Bonuses

| Category | Stats | Example Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Armor** (Heavy/Medium/Light) | St/Ag/St, Ag/St/Qu, Ag/Qu/St | Plate, Chain, Leather |
| **Weapon** (1H Edge, 2H, Pole, Missile, Thrown) | St/Ag/St, St/St/Ag, St/Ag/St, Ag/St, Ag/St | Broadsword, Two-Handed Sword, Spear, Longbow, Dagger |
| **Combat Maneuvers** | St/Ag/Qu | Disarm, Reverse Stroke, Subdual |
| **Body Development** | Co/Co/SD | (Hit point development) |
| **Athletic** (Gymnastics/Brawn) | Ag/Qu/St, St/Co/St | Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Jumping |
| **Outdoor** (Animal/Environmental) | Em/In/Pr, In/Re/SD | Animal Handling, Riding, Tracking, Survival, Navigation |
| **Subterfuge** (Attack/Mechanics/Stealth) | Ag/Qu/In, In/Re/Ag, Ag/SD/In | Ambush, Lockpicking, Stalking, Hiding, Pick Pockets |
| **Awareness** (Perceptions/Searching) | In/Re, In/Re/Em | Alertness, Observation, Tracking, Trap Detection |
| **Magical** (varies by realm) | Realm stat ×3 | Power Point Development, Spell Lists, Runes, Attunement |
| **Communication** | Em/In/Pr | Influence, Duping, Trading, Public Speaking, Seduction |
| **Lore** (General/Magical/Obscure/Technical) | Re/Me, Re/Me/Em, Re/Me/In, Re/Me/In | History, Arcane Lore, Religion, Herb Lore, Region Lore |
| **Craft** | Ag/Re/St or In/Re/Em | Smithing, Woodworking, Cooking, Alchemy, First Aid |
| **Self Control** | SD/SD/SD | Meditation, Adrenal Moves, Frenzy |
| **Special** (varies) | varies | Ambush, Linguistics, Music, Martial Arts Sweeps/Strikes |

**Resolution:** d100 (open-ended) + skill ranks + category bonus + stat bonuses vs. difficulty. Category bonus applies to ALL skills in that category — investing in category ranks is more efficient but shallower than individual skill ranks.

### Which Stats Feed Perception/Awareness?

| System | Noticing Things | Reading People | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AD&D** | Wisdom (WIS) | Wisdom (WIS) | Single stat covers all awareness |
| **Rolemaster** | Intuition (In) + Reasoning (Re) | In + Re + Empathy (Em) | Social perception adds Em |
| **DSA** | KL + IN + IN (Sinnesschärfe) | KL + IN + CH (Menschenkenntnis) | CH replaces second IN for social reads |
| **GURPS** | Perception (Per) | Perception (Per) or IQ | Per is secondary stat derived from IQ, bought independently |
| **CoC** | Flat skill % (Spot Hidden, Listen) | Flat skill % (Psychology) | No governing stat — pure trained skill |

RM and DSA both split "noticing things" (In/Re) from "reading people" (Em/CH) at the stat level. AD&D and GURPS collapse everything into one stat (WIS / Per). CoC sidesteps it entirely with flat trained percentages.

## Unique System Mechanics

| Feature | System | Description |
|---|---|---|
| THAC0 / Descending AC | AD&D | To-hit rolls: d20 + bonuses ≥ THAC0 − target AC |
| Non-Weapon Proficiencies | AD&D 2e | Skill-like system bolted onto class/level framework |
| Open-Ended Rolls | Rolemaster | Roll 96–100: roll again and add. Roll 01–05: roll again and subtract |
| Critical Strike Tables | Rolemaster | Separate tables per damage type (Slash/Crush/Puncture/Heat/Cold/Electricity...) |
| Fumble Tables | Rolemaster | Detailed fumble results per action type |
| Development Points | Rolemaster | Per-level skill point allocation; develop category ranks (broad) and skill ranks (specific) separately, both weighted by 2–3 stat bonuses |
| 3d20 Talent Check | DSA | Roll 3 separate d20s vs 3 different attributes, spend skill points to compensate. Both DSA and Rolemaster use 3 stats per skill — DSA rolls against them directly, RM adds their bonuses to a single d100 |
| Quality Levels (QS) | DSA 5e | Remaining skill points / 3 = quality of success |
| Advantages/Disadvantages | GURPS, DSA | Point-buy character traits (+/− cost) |
| Tech Levels | GURPS | TL0 (Stone Age) to TL12+ (Interstellar), affects available skills/equipment |
| Sanity System | CoC | SAN loss from Mythos encounters, permanent vs temporary insanity |
| Luck Points | CoC 7e | Spendable resource to modify rolls, decreases over time |
| Bonus/Penalty Dice | CoC 7e | Roll extra tens die, keep best/worst |
| Opposed Rolls | CoC 7e, DSA, GURPS | Competing skill checks (not present in classic AD&D or RM) |
